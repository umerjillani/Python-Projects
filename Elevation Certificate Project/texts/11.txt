‘The ADIBC is based on the 2009 IBC. 2009 IBC code sections referenced
in this report are the same sections in the ADIBC.

Properties evaluated:
@ Physical operation
@ Water flow

2.0 USES

The Smart Vent® units are engineered mechanically
operated flood vents (FVs) employed to equalize
hydrostatic pressure on walls of enclosures subject to
rising or falling flood waters. Certain models also allow
natural ventilation.

3.0 DESCRIPTION
3.1 General:

When subjected to rising water, the Smart Vent® FVs
internal floats are activated, then pivot open to allow flow in
either direction to equalize water level and hydrostatic
pressure from one side of the foundation to the other. The
FV pivoting door is normally held in the closed position by
a buoyant release device. When subjected to rising water,
the buoyant release device causes the unit to unlatch,
allowing the door to rotate out of the way and allow flow.

The water level stabilizes, equalizing the lateral forces.
Each unit is fabricated from stainless steel. Smart Vent®
Automatic Foundation Flood Vents are available in
various models and sizes as described in Table 1. The
SmartVENT® Stacking Model #1540-511 and FloodVENT®
Stacking Model #1540-521 units each contain two
vertically arranged openings per unit.

3.2 Engineered Opening:

The FVs comply with the design principle noted in Section
2.7.2.2 and Section 2.7.3 of ASCE/SEI 24-14 [Section
2.6.2.2 of ASCE/SEI 24-05 (2012, 2009, 2006 IBC and
IRC)] for a maximum rate of rise and fall of 5.0 feet per
hour (0.423 mm/s). In order to comply with the engineered
opening requirement of ASCE/SEI 24, Smart Vent FVs
must be installed in accordance with Section 4.0.

3.3 Ventilation:

The SmartVENT® Model #1540-510 and SmartVENT®
Overhead Door Model #1540-514 both have screen covers
with ‘/4-inch- by-"/4-inch (6.35 by 6. 35 mm) openings,
yielding 51 square inches (32 903 mm 2) of net free area to
supply natural ventilation. The SmartVENT® Stacking
Model #1540-511 consists of two Model #1540-510 units
in one assembly, and provides 102 square inches
(65 806 mm?) of net free area to supply natural ventilation.
Other FVs recognized in this report do not offer natural
ventilation.

4.0 DESIGN AND INSTALLATION

SmartVENT® and FloodVENT® are designed to be
installed into walls or overhead doors of existing or new
construction from the exterior side. Installation of the
vents must be in accordance with the manufacturer’s
instructions, the applicable code and this report.
Installation clips allow mounting in masonry and concrete
walls of any thickness. In order to comply with the
engineered opening design principle noted in Section
2.7.2.2 and 2.7.3 of ASCE/SE! 24-14 [Section 2.6.2.2 of
ASCE/SEI 24-05 (2012, 2009, 2006 IBC and IRC)], the
Smart Vent® FVs must be installed as follows:

@ With a minimum of two openings on different sides of
each enclosed area.

mg With a minimum of one FV for every 200 square
feet (18.6 m?) of enclosed area, except that the
SmartVENT® Stacking Model #1540-511 and
FloodVENT® Stacking Model #1540-521 must be
installed with a minimum of one FV for every
400 square feet (37.2 m i) of enclosed area.

@ Below the base flood elevation.
