ELEVATION CERTIFICATE

SECTION D-SURVEYOR CERTIFICATION(CONTINUED)

Per the Firm Map “Mason County, Washington”; Community-Panel Number 5301150175 D,
Effective Date December 8, 1998, no base flood elevation has been determined in this area.
Therefore to be above any 100 year flood, the residence must be at least 2.0 feet higher than the
Highest Adjacent Ground.

On July 29, 2002 observations were made on the Mason County Bench Mark known as TBM #20
“White”. “White” is not shown on said Firm Map. Per Mason County Department of Public
Works this Bench Mark is a Railroad Spike located in Power Pole #V108 at Mile 4.98 on the South
Side of the Skokomish Valley Road. The Bench Mark elevation is 80.97 feet NGVD 88.

Differential Levels were run to the project Site and the finished floor of the existing residence was
found to be at 82.8 feet NGVD 88. the Highest Adjacent Ground was at 82.00 feet NGVD 88. The
existing residence was to be raised a minimum of 1.2 feet to be higher than any projected 100 year
flood.

On June 23, 2005, following notification of the completion of the house-raising project, the
abovedescribed site was revisited. Differential Levels were run to the project Site from the
“White” Bench Mark. The finished floor of the raised residence was found to be at 82.8 feet
NGVD 88. The Highest Adjacent Ground was at 81.7 feet NGVD 88 (actually lower than the
original measurement due to some grading having been done). After the raising of the residence
the finished floor is 2.3 feet higher than the highest adjacent ground and should be above the flood
level of any 100 year flood. .

The site was visited once again on September 11, 2006 to verify the area of the vent openings and
to obtain photographs for use in the attached updated Elevation Certificate (expiration February 28,

2009). Additionally no “machinery or equipment servicing the residence” (question C2e) had been
previously observed. I speculate that said equipment is in the detached shop, which has a floor

elevation of 82.5 NGVD 88.
