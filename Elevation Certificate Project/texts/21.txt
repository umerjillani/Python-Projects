Whether you are in a high risk zone or not, you may need flood insurance (https://www.fema.gov/national-flood-
insurance-program) because most homeowners insurance doesn't cover flood damage. If you live in an area with low
or moderate flood risk, you are 5 times more likely to experience flood than a fire in your home over the next 30 years.
For many, a National Flood Insurance Program's flood insurance policy could cost less than $400 per year. Call your
insurance agent today and protect what you've built.

 

 

Learn more about steps you can take (https://www.fema.gov/what-mitigation) to reduce flood risk damage.
