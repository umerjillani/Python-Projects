PRIVACY ACT STATEMENT

 

 

 

Authority: Title 44 CFR § 61.7 and 61.8.

Principal Purpose(s): This information is being collected for the primary purpose of documenting compliance with National Flood
Insurance Program (NFIP) floodplain management ordinances for new or substantially improved structures in designated Special Flood
Hazard Areas. This form may also be used as an optional tool for a Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA), Conditional LOMA (CLOMA), Letter
of Map Revision Based on Fill (LOMR-F), or Conditional LOMR-F (CLOMR-F), or for flood insurance rating purposes in any flood zone.

Routine Use(s): The information on this form may be disclosed as generally permitted under 5 U.S.C. § 552a(b) of the Privacy Act of 1974,
as amended. This includes using this information as necessary and authorized by the routine uses published in DHS/ FEMA-003 — National
Flood Insurance Program Files System of Records Notice 79 Fed. Reg. 28747 (May 19, 2014) and upon written request, written consent, by
agreement, or as required by law.

Disclosure: The disclosure of information on this form is voluntary; however, failure to provide the information requested may impact the
flood insurance premium through the NFIP. Information will only be released as permitted by law.

PURPOSE OF THE ELEVATION CERTIFICATE

 

The Elevation Certificate is an important administrative tool of the NFIP. It can be used to provide elevation information necessary to ensure
compliance with community floodplain management ordinances, to inform the proper insurance premium, and to support a request for a
LOMA, CLOMA, LOMR-F, or CLOMR-F.

The Elevation Certificate is used to document floodplain management compliance for Post-Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) buildings,
which are buildings constructed after publication of the FIRM, located in flood Zones A1—A30, AE, AH, AO, A (with Base Flood Elevation
(BFE)), VE, V1-V30, V (with BFE), AR, AR/A, AR/AE, AR/A1—A30, AR/AH, AR/AO, and AQ9. It may also be used to provide elevation
information for Pre-FIRM buildings or buildings in any flood zone.

As part of the agreement for making flood insurance available in a community, the NFIP requires the community to adopt floodplain
management regulations that specify minimum requirements for reducing flood losses. One such requirement is for the community to obtain
the elevation of the lowest floor (including basement) of all new and substantially improved buildings, and maintain a record of such
information. The Elevation Certificate provides a way for a community to document compliance with the community's floodplain
management ordinance.

Use of this certificate does not provide a waiver of the flood insurance purchase requirement. Only a LOMA or LOMR-F from the Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) can amend the FIRM and remove the federal mandate for a lending institution to require the
purchase of flood insurance. However, the lending institution has the option of requiring flood insurance even if a LOMA/LOMR-F has been
issued by FEMA. The Elevation Certificate may be used to support a LOMA, CLOMA, LOMR-F, or CLOMR-F request. Lowest Adjacent
Grade (LAG) elevations certified by a land surveyor, engineer, or architect, as authorized by state law, will be required if the certificate is
used to support aLOMA, CLOMA, LOMR-F, or CLOMR-F request. ALOMA, CLOMA, LOMR-F, or CLOMR-F request must be submitted
with either a completed FEMA MT-EZ or MT-1 application package, whichever is appropriate. If the certificate will only be completed to
support a LOMA, CLOMA, LOMR-F, or CLOMR-F request, there is an option to document the certified LAG elevation on the Elevation Form
included in the MT-EZ and MT-1 application.

This certificate is used only to certify building elevations. A separate certificate is required for floodproofing. Under the NFIP, non-residential
buildings can be floodproofed up to or above the BFE. A floodproofed building is a building that has been designed and constructed to be
watertight (substantially impermeable to floodwaters) below the BFE. Floodproofing of residential buildings is not permitted under the NFIP
unless FEMA has granted the community an exception for residential floodproofed basements. The community must adopt standards for
design and construction of floodproofed basements before FEMA will grant a basement exception. For both floodproofed non-residential
buildings and residential floodproofed basements in communities that have been granted an exception by FEMA, a floodproofing certificate
is required.

The expiration date on the form herein does not apply to certified and completed Elevation Certificates, as a completed Elevation Certificate
does not expire, unless there is a physical change to the building that invalidates information in Section A Items A8 or AQ, Section C, Section
E, or Section H. In addition, this form is intended for the specific building referenced in Section A and is not invalidated by the transfer of
building ownership.

Additional guidance can be found in FEMA Publication 467-1, Floodplain Management Bulletin: Elevation Certificate.
