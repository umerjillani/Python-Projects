Whether you are in a high risk zone or not, you may need flood insurance (https://www.fema.gov/national-flood-insurance-program)
because most homeowners insurance doesn't cover flood damage. If you live in an area with low or moderate flood risk, you are 5 times
more likely to experience flood than a fire in your home over the next 30 years. For many, a National Flood Insurance Program's flood
insurance policy could cost less than $400 per year. Call your insurance agent today and protect what you've built.

Learn more about steps you can take (https://www.fema.gov/what-mitigation) to reduce flood risk damage.
