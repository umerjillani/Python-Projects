NOTICE OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARDS AND AVAILABILITY OF FEDERAL DISASTER RELIEF ASSISTANCE

Loan Information

Lender: Crestmark Mortgage Company LTD

Borrower Name: Reno, Ralph Albert

Property Address: 21706 Turkey Tangle Court , Cypress, TX 77433
Loan Identifier: 7300036667

Determination Date: 10/24/2024

Determination Number: 14116509

We are giving you this notice to inform you that:

The building or mobile home securing the loan for which you have applied is or will be located in an area with special flood hazards.

The area has been identified by the Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) as a special flood hazard area using
FEMA's Flood Insurance Rate Map or the Flood Hazard Boundary Map for the following community: Harris County*. This area has a one
percent (1%) chance of a flood equal to or exceeding the base flood elevation (a 100-year flood) in any given year. During the life of a 30-year
mortgage loan, the risk of a 100-year flood in a special flood hazard area is 26 percent (26%).

Federal law allows a lender and borrower jointly to request the Administrator of FEMA to review the determination of whether the property
securing the loan is located in a special flood hazard area. If you would like to make such a request, please contact us for further information.

The community in which the property securing the loan is located participates in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). Federal
law will not allow us to make you the loan that you have applied for if you do not purchase flood insurance. The flood insurance must be
maintained for the life of the loan. If you fail to purchase or renew flood insurance on the property, Federal law authorizes and requires us
to purchase the flood insurance for you at your expense.

« Ata minimum, flood insurance purchased must cover the lesser of: (1) the outstanding principal balance of the loan; or (2) the
maximum amount of coverage allowed for the type of property under the NFIP.

Flood insurance coverage under the NFIP is limited to the building or mobile home and any personal property that secures your loan and
not the land itself.

e Federal disaster relief assistance (usually in the form of a low-interest loan) may be available for damages incurred in excess of
your flood insurance if your community's participation in the NFIP is in accordance with NFIP requirements.

e Although you may not be required to maintain flood insurance on all structures, you may still wish to do so, and your mortgage
lender may still require you to do so to protect the collateral securing the mortgage. If you choose not to maintain flood insurance
on a structure and it floods, you are responsible for all flood losses relating to that structure.

Availability of Private Flood Insurance Coverage

Flood insurance coverage under the NFIP may be purchased through an insurance agent who will obtain the policy either directly through
the NFIP or through an insurance company that participates in the NFIP. Flood insurance that provides the same level of coverage as a
standard flood insurance policy under the NFIP may be available from private insurers that do not participate in the NFIP. You should
compare the flood insurance coverage, deductibles, exclusions, conditions, and premiums associated with flood insurance policies issued
on behalf of the NFIP and policies issued on behalf of private insurance companies and contact an insurance agent as to the availability,
cost, and comparisons of flood insurance coverage.

Escrow Requirement for Residential Loans

Federal law may require a lender or its servicer to escrow all premiums and fees for flood insurance that covers any residential building or
mobile home securing a loan that is located in an area with special flood hazards. If your lender notifies you that an escrow account is
required for your loan, then you must pay your flood insurance premiums and fees to the lender or its servicer with the same frequency as
you make loan payments for the duration of your loan. These premiums and fees will be deposited in the escrow account, which will be
used to pay the flood insurance provider.

Flood insurance coverage under the NFIP is not available for the property securing the loan because the community in which the property
is located does not participate in the NFIP. In addition, if the non-participating community has been identified for at least one year as
containing a special flood hazard area, properties located in the community will not be eligible for Federal disaster relief assistance in the
event of a Federally declared flood disaster.

We have received, read, and understand a copy of this document.
