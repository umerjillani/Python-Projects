Whether you are in a high risk zone or not, you may need îood insurance (https://www.fema.gov/national-îood-
insurance-program) because most homeowners insurance doesn't cover îood damage. If you live in an area with low
or moderate îood risk, you are 5 times more likely to experience îood than a íre in your home over the next 30 years.
For many, a National Flood Insurance Program's îood insurance policy could cost less than $400 per year. Call your
insurance agent today and protect what you've built.
Learn more about steps you can take (https://www.fema.gov/what-mitigation) to reduce îood risk damage.
